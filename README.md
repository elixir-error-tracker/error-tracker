# ErrorTracker

En Elixir based built-in error tracking solution.

## Configuration

Set up the repository:

```elixir
config :error_tracker,
  repo: MyApp.Repo
```

And you are ready to go!

By default Phoenix and Oban integrations will start registering exceptions.

If you want to also catch exceptions before your Phoenix Router (in plugs used
on your Endpoint) or your application just use `Plug` but not `Phoenix`, you can
attach to those errors with:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  use ErrorTracker.Integrations.Plug
end
```

## Development

### Development server

We have a `dev.exs` script that starts a development server.

To run it together with an `IEx` console you can do:

```
iex -S mix dev
```

### Assets

In ortder to participate in the development of this library, you may need to
know how to compile the assets needed to use the Web UI.

To do so, you need to first make a clean build:

```
mix do assets.install, assets.build
```

That task will build the JS and CSS of the project.

The JS is not expected to change too much because we rely in LiveView, but if
you make any change just execute that command again and you are good to go.

In the case of CSS, as it is automatically generated by Tailwind, you need to
start the watcher when your intention is to modify the classes used.

To do so you can execute this task in a separate terminal:

```
mix assets.watch
```
